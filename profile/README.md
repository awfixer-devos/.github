# DevOS

because development on a normal operating system is like pulling teeth.

The goal of DevOS is to provide an enviorment for developing that includes everything you need. This means a custom package manager, custom configurations, and true Integraded Development Experience.


our roadmap is pretty simple right now

we will be using the [Kernel] that we are building for all of our operating systems, we will be using a modified version of [Zed] and we are building a rendering engine that will allow you to render things in a way that is not currently possible (will be revelealed post repo creation for licensing reasons)

### Licensing

we will have a dual license here (AGPL or GPL plus a Enterprise/business source) to ensure fair and equitable use of the projects here. Pricing is managed at the Discretion of [AWFixer and Freinds] and has not been decided as of yet.
